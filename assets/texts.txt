      A game by Jubatian\e\

     for the Uzebox JAMMA\e\p\
    You will never be free\e\p\
They  wanted  you  to  fight\
their  war.  They locked you\
deep  underground  to  break\
you.  You only  wanted to be\
free...\e\
\e\
A loud  rumble  awakens you.\
The floor caved in.  This is\
your chance to run...\e\p\
Use your fire and agility to\
push forth for your freedom.\e\
\e\
Don't  kill  people  if  you\
don't have to.\e\
\e\
B ..............: Fire\e\
X, A ...........: Jump\e\
Y ..............: Walk\e\
Up .............: Look up\e\
Left, Right ....: Move\e\
Down ...........: Look down\e\p\
Escaping the  immediate area\
of your  captivity  you  can\
have some rest.  But not for\
long!  You know they will be\
following you! You can avoid\
being  discovered  for a few\
days  until you  reach  near\
the river Tychon.\e\
\e\
Bad  timing!  You  encounter\
the military once again, and\
know you have to cross fast!\
There   must   be  a  bridge\
somewhere...\e\p\
Nightfall and  dense forests\
on the  other bank  help you\
losing your pursuers.  Hilly\
regions loom ahead, you know\
them, the  estates of Border\
Lords  with   their  dreaded\
castles. This is going to be\
a difficult march...\e\p\
Tired and exhausted you look\
up on the  fortifications of\
a great castle. Is this your\
doom? You certainly won't be\
able to get across here.\e\
\e\
Then you recall  a small pit\
you passed earlier. Could it\
be a cave?  At least a place\
where you could hide for the\
night?\e\p\
Running,   fleeing,   always\
running. You stormed through\
the  mine  you   unknowingly\
entered  to   reach  a  wast\
abandonned system.\e\
\e\
You ceased to know time.  It\
is an  eternal  night  here,\
only your fire making light.\
You  wander  around by  your\
numb senses hoping you could\
find your way. Then...\e\p\
You fought your  way through\
the last fortification,  you\
ascended the  last mountain.\
Now you  look down  the wast\
distance,  the  magnificence\
of the sunset  over a walley\
which you remember...\e\
\e\
This is the  entrance to the\
land  of  dragons.  You  are\
finally home. You are free!\e\p\
           The  End\e\
