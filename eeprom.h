/*
** Supports saving / loading game scores from / to EEPROM, automatically
** handling Uzebox error conditions in a sane manner.
**
** The score data is as follows:
**
** There are 3 high score entries, each entry taking 10 6 bit characters (only
** low 6 bits of the bytes are filled, see text.h for layout) and 2 bytes of
** high score value. So it totals 36 bytes (but due to the compression of the
** text part it fits in the 30 + 2 byte EEPROM block).
**
** The EEPROM block ID is 0xF0AD (For FoaD: Flight of a Dragon), stored in
** Little Endian format in the EEPROM itself (as the Uzebox kernel does this).
