Sprites.


The sprite engine's core is described in sprite.h. This part realizes the
"compression" of the dragon sprite, and is also responsible for all other
sprites.

Currently its particle generator feature is unused (Mode 74 can place
individual pixels, this would rely on that, but it can not use palette
replacements directly which is utilized for several purposes).
