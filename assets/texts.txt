    Keep the spirit alive!\e\p\
Escaping the  immediate area\
of your  captivity  you  can\
have some rest.  But not for\
long!  You know they will be\
following you! You can avoid\
being  discovered  for a few\
days  until you  reach  near\
the river Tychon.\e\
\e\
Bad  timing!  You  encounter\
the military once again, and\
know you have to cross fast!\
There   must   be  a  bridge\
somewhere...\e\p\
You  did it!  It is  still a\
long way to go,  though, but\
this short demo for now ends\
here.\e\p\
