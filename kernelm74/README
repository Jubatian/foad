Customized kernel for the game

Mode74 is as-is without modifications.

Uses a new sync generation which for this game (196 pixels tall screen) gains
about 6000 VBlank cycles total. This includes inline mixer modifications.

The inline mixer has 5 identical wave channels (no noise channel).

The "waves" definition is removed, it is provided along with the game's
resources in a 256b aligned block (saving bytes otherwise wasted for
alignment). Also the Uzebox logo uses waveform 2 in intro.h (this is triangle
in the game, later the logo might be removed to free ROM for more valuable
game data).

VSync tasks are completely removed along with all related variables & code.
Everything is called explicitly from the game as needed. This fixes occasional
audio glitches since the VSync tasks (with the sound & music processing) could
fire within the setup of a sound effect.

Audio is simplified and rewritten for the 5 identical wave channel concept.
Music playing is realized by the game itself, all music playback related
elements are removed from the kernel.

Patches are changed somewhat, notably TriggerNote no longer sets the envelope
volume (so previous note volumes might carry on, providing smoother
transitions to new notes, however this needs sligtly different patch design).

Unneeded kernel functions are removed to free up some ROM space and RAM bytes
(ROM space only where one or another feature couldn't be entirely removed by
link time optimizations).

Removed all files which are unnecessary for the game:

- Video modes apart from Mode 74
- SD card interfacing (along with FAT FS routines)
- Intro logo's PCM wave
- All kernel supplied waveforms
- Scroll table used for some scrolling video modes
- VSync mixer (game uses inline mixer)
- UART
