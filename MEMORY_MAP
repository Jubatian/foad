The game's memory map:



Uses the reset concept of Mode 74 (that is, at the end of the frame, the video
mode jumps at a reset address instead of popping, thus also discarding the
complete main stack).



0x10F9 - 0x10FF: Free
0x1051 - 0x10F8: RAM tile allocation workspace (for up to 56 RAM tiles)
0x1000 - 0x1050: Row selectors (for up to 27 slices)
0x0FC0 - 0x0FFF: Palette buffer & RAM tile mask indices
0x0FA0 - 0x0FBF: Palette buffer & X shift map
0x0F00 - 0x0F9F: Palette buffer & Main Stack
0x0EF0 - 0x0FFF: Video Stack & Main Stack
0x0E30 - 0x0EEF: Color 0 replacement table (24 rows: Row 6 - 29)
0x0E10 - 0x0E2F: VRAM (32 characters wide status row or combined with below)
0x0BB8 - 0x0E0F: VRAM (600 bytes for 25x24 scroll)
0x0BB3 - 0x0BB7: Free
0x0BB1 - 0x0BB2: Top & Text area palette (Only colors 1 and 2 are used)
0x0BB0 - 0x0BB0: Text area palette (Used if color replacement is needed)
0x0BA0 - 0x0BAF: Main area palette
0x0B80 - 0x0B9F: Tile row descriptors
0x0400 - 0x0B7F: RAM tiles (60)
0x0300 - 0x03FF: L0 block replacements
0x0100 - 0x02FF: Auto-allocated by linker

Stack notes: The main stack if it ever overflowed would spill into the Color 0
replacement table. The updating of this table has no such defect, while if it
happens elsewhere, the result is either nothing or the background having
miscolored rows piling up on the top (as the stack wrote over the entries),
which is a tolearable result.



Color 0 replacement table:

Only 24 rows used. For the rest, color 0 is unused, so anything can be there
(it will replace color 0, but without effect). This is utilized in the memory
map above.



Layout of the bytes marked Free:

0x10F9 - 0x10FF: MEM_LOC_0 - MEM_LOC_6
0x0BB3 - 0x0BB7: MEM_LOC_7 - MEM_LOC_B

MEM_LOC_0: mapact.s
MEM_LOC_1: mapact.s
MEM_LOC_2: mapact.s
MEM_LOC_3: mapact.s
MEM_LOC_4: parallax.s
MEM_LOC_5: parallax.s
MEM_LOC_6: level.s
MEM_LOC_7: level.s
MEM_LOC_8: level.s
MEM_LOC_9: level.s
MEM_LOC_A: random.s
MEM_LOC_B: random.s

(Note: Some cases two bytes have to be after each other, so be careful when
modifying this mapping)
