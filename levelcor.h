/*
** Encodes and decodes level (map) coordinates.
**
** The maximal possible dimension of a map on an axis is 8192 pixels (256 L0
** blocks). The same time assuming allowing at most 2048 L0 blocks (requiring
** 256 bytes of replacement map RAM), 2M pixels is the maximal map area. This
** requires 21 coordinate bits, which allows the coordinates to be represented
** in 3 bytes (instead of 4 which would be used if they were uint16s).
**
** Using the map height (level_h) this performs such encoding.
**
** The encoding is fixed, supporting 8192 x 2048 pixels. The reason is that
** tall maps aren't typical (in the end I didn't need such), so there was no
** point in supporting them. The maximal height is limited to 28 L1 blocks
** (due to 256 pixels top / bottom clearance).
