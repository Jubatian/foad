Global variables


Some variables are exposed as globals.

These are variables which should be accessible normally through a getter which
would ensure read only access. The problem with getters is that it clobbers
the whole set of registers available to functions, so causing the caller to
produce costly pushes and pops (above the call & ret overhead), which is not
only slow, but also bloats code size.

In modules where this is a problem such internal variables are exposed for
reading only.

Exposed global variables are never meant to be written!


(Sadly this can not be enforced by the "const" keyword as it introduces other
problems, namely that the compiler could assume it doesn't change, so it could
optimize accesses out even accross function calls. The "volatile" keyword
could solve this, but that also could become a performance cripple)
