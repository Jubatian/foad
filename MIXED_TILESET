Mixed tilesets


This is a concept utilizing recoloring to enable conversing some ROM by
packing sprite tiles.


The dragon has 7 color + transparency sprite tiles. This uses the low 3 bits
of sprite tiles, with the following remapper:

T1234567T1234567

This recoloring scheme detaches the high bit, which can be used for monochrome
tiles with a remapper as follows:

TTTTTTTT11111111

This provides a lot of monochrome sprite tiles with no extra ROM cost.


Beyond the dragon, the following other schemes may be used:

3 + T / 3 + T split:

T123T123T123T123 for sprite tiles using the low 2 bits.
TTTT111122223333 for sprite tiles using the high 2 bits.

4 + T / 2 + T split:

T1234T1234T1234- for the 4 + T sprite tiles.
TTTTT1111122222- for the 2 + T sprite tiles.
